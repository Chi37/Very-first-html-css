Throughout my college career, I have been involved with building bridges between cultures. <br> I have been a part of Project Pengyou, an organization that aims to connect American and Chinese culture. <br> I have also been a part of other organizations such as the Vietnamese-Student Association <br>and the Korean-American Associatioin on campus. I also have traveled to Taiwan to lead a roundtable discussion and traveled abroad in Italy. </p><br>

I studied in International Studies and got a certificate in Education and Educational Services thinking I was going to work for the government with exchange programs. However, that did not work out as I got rejected from so many places in the East Coast. </p><br>

I was abroad in Beijing, China last August to attend a month long program at Tsinghua University. My team and I worked on a project to reduce waste water and reuse rain water. We talked about Sponge Cities, which just means adding greenery to pavements in the cities to absorb and filter water. </p><br>
